# 🔍 Quick Filter UI

This is a simple browser-based filtering tool built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to type a keyword into a search box and instantly filter a list of items. This project demonstrates the use of **arrow functions**, **event handling**, and **DOM manipulation** in JavaScript.
